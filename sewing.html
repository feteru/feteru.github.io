<h1> Sewing project 1: Fanny pack</h1>

<p> First sewing project: Framebag.</p>
    

<h1> Project 2: Large frame bag</h1>
<p> Designed for my bareknuckle / bridgestone. First attempt at making a frame bag. 
    Left myself tons of space on the seam allowance, but that ended up being somewhat difficult to sew
    and the bag also turned out larger than intended.
</p>

<h1> Project 3: Small frame bag for MTNCAT100</h1>

<img src="/files/GiantFrameBagClosed.jpg" alt="Fanny pack front view" style="width: 768px;">

<p> Designed for my 2017 Giant Anthem Advanced 0, size S. 
    Was planning on riding the MTNCAT100, and needed space for my snacks for a whole long day.
    Bonus: it fits a 25oz beverage, although on trails it will get quite banged up.
</p>

<h1> Project 4: Feedbags 1 & 2</h1>
<p> Made two feedbags as gifts out of some white X-pac. It's actually Eco-pac 200
    Unfortunately don't have a ton of other pictures of these. 
</p>

<h1> Project 5: Coming soon! Top tube bags</h1>
<p> 
    In the planning stages now for a top tube bag. Looking to explore a magnetic closure, using a 3d
    printed insert that the magnets will get inserted into.
