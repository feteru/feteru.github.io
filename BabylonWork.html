        <h1>My professional work at Babylon Microfarms</h1>
        <p>by me, 2019-2024</p>

        <p class="view">I've been working at Babylon Micro-farms since Summer 2019 as a Mechanical Engineer. I've also taken on Product Management responsibilities. It's been the vast majority of my professional experience, and the company has grown and changed massively since I've been there, from 12 to 47 employees, raising over $11mm in Seed and Series A venture funding and over $2mm additionally from grant funding. In that time we've developed 4 iterations of advanced on-site hydroponic farms, and built and installed over 250 units around the world. 

	<p> <b> Key milestones and my contributions: </b> </p>

	<p> <em> 1. Early days, the V5 and NSF research </em>
	Spent lots of time learning about hydroponics and working with suppliers to build a product. I was the sole mechanical engineer on the team for  long while, so I worked heavily with engineers at our plastics and frame manufacturers for support. 
  
	
	</p>
	<p> 2. V6 Development & Launch 

	Got a patent which was approved in early 2024! 
	I contributed to system architecture, refining the irrigation method, and designing custom components to integrate the growing system. Figures 13, 14 and 15 are my novel designs which allowed several key features:

 - Easily removable trays, whether or not the system is irrigating. This enables users to leave the farm in Autofarmer mode, the smart automated schedule.

 - Easily manufacturable in a small shop

 - Modular approach, that allowed the irrigation to be made up of 20 smaller sub-trays (later to become the GrowServe system), and giving us flexibility to the overall size of the unit. This same modular approach also allowed for easily growing either individual plants, or microgreen sheets.

	<p> 3. V6 Support
	</p>
	
	4. NSF Research round 2

	Mention setting up the grow room, working with interns to create the quadricropter, fancy cameras, installing one at Greenswell growers.

	4. Galleri development and launch

	Owned frame design, spent months in Solidworks. Helped onboard our supply chain team, built prototypes and first production units, developed build instructions. On the build instructions, created a system where we split the build instructions into their component parts, split the BOM, and then split the work floor along with this.
Later the supply chain team worked with a lean consultant to then transform this into an almost-one-piece-flow lean production system, with stores for each of the subassemblies. 

	5. Galleri support, CE certification, international installs, configuration management, retrofits, RCCA.

	6. STEM Garden Development & Launch
