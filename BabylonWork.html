        <h1>My work at Babylon Microfarms</h1>
        <p>by me, 2019-2024</p>

        <p class="view">I've been working at Babylon Micro-farms since Summer 2019. It's been the vast majority of my work experience, and the company has grown and changed massively since I've been there. 

	Key milestones and my contributions:
	1. Early days, the V5 and NSF research
	Spent lots of time learning about hydroponics. This was my 
	2. V6 Development & Launch
	3. V6 Support
	4. NSF Research round 2
	Mention setting up the grow room, working with interns to create the quadricropter, fancy cameras, installing one at Greenswell growers.
	4. Galleri development and launch
	Owned frame design, spent months in Solidworks. Helped onboard our supply chain team, built prototypes and first production units, developed build instructions. On the build instructions, created a system where we split the build instructions into their component parts, split the BOM, and then split the work floor along with this.
Later the supply chain team worked with a lean consultant to then transform this into an almost-one-piece-flow lean production system, with stores for each of the subassemblies. 
	5. Galleri support, CE certification, international installs, configuration management, retrofits, RCCA.
	6. STEM Garden Development & Launch
