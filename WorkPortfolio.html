<h1>My work at Babylon Microfarms</h1>
        <p>by me, 2019-2024</p>

        <p class="view">I've been working at Babylon Micro-farms since Summer 2019. It's been the vast majority of my work experience, and the company has grown and changed massively since I've been there. 

	<p> <b> Key milestones and my contributions: </b> </p>

	<p> <em> 1. Early days, the V5 and NSF research </em>
	Spent lots of time learning about hydroponics. This was my 
	
	</p>
	<p> 2. V6 Development & Launch 

	As the sole mechanical engineer on the team, I did a lot of the development work on the V6 microfarm, which ultimately led to a patent which was approved in early 2024! 

	<p>You can see the details here: <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11930746B2/en?oq=11930746">Patent US11930746B2</a></p>
	<p>I contributed to system architecture, refining the irrigation method, and designing custom components to integrate the growing system. Figures 13, 14 and 15 are my novel designs which allowed several key features: <br>
	
 - Easily removable trays, whether or not the system is irrigating. This enables users to leave the farm in Autofarmer mode, the smart automated schedule. <br>

 - Easily manufacturable in a small shop with limited resources <br>

 - Modular approach, that allowed the irrigation to be made up of 20 smaller sub-trays (later to become the GrowServe system), and giving us flexibility to the overall size of the unit. This same modular approach also allowed for easily growing either individual plants, or microgreen sheets. <br>
	</p>

	<p> 3. V6 Support
	</p>
	
	<p> 4. NSF Research round 2 <br>

	Mention setting up the grow room, working with interns to create the quadricropter, fancy cameras, installing one at Greenswell growers.
	</p>
	4. Galleri development and launch

	Owned frame design, spent months in Solidworks. Helped onboard our supply chain team, built prototypes and first production units, developed build instructions. On the build instructions, created a system where we split the build instructions into their component parts, split the BOM, and then split the work floor along with this.
Later the supply chain team worked with a lean consultant to then transform this into an almost-one-piece-flow lean production system, with stores for each of the subassemblies. 

	5. Galleri support, CE certification, international installs, configuration management, retrofits, RCCA. <br>

	After Galleri launched, 

	International installs: We've expanded our product line to noto

	6. STEM Garden Development & Launch <br>
	
	In 2023, we began exploring concepts for a different, lower cost unit. <br>
